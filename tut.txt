!!!you need node to make this work!!!

run npm install discord.js
run npm install dotenv


create a src folder then an index.js
go into package json change "main": "index.js" to "main": "src/index.js"


create a .env file (removed for security)
then write: TOKEN = YOURTOKEN
your file should look like this:
//
TOKEN = SJn2jkdsai24kfs.esif.234hjskasj
// note! not a real token



this has an outdated API do not download and use
if you are using your pc as a server use the comand "node ." to run the bot



written command tut:

client.on(Events.ClientReady, (x) => {
const nameOfComand =  new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName ('Name people will see')
    .setDescription('description people will see')

     client.application.commands.create(create the command)

}) // this is the setup of the command block and the start builder

client.on('interactionCreate', (interaction) => {
      if(!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return //this checks if it was a command or just written

    if(interaction.commandName === 'check if command was written') {
        interaction.reply('what bot says back')
    }
}) // this is your command interaction block
    client.login(process.env.TOKEN) // to make sure ur bot gets logged in
